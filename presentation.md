## Why Learn `git`?
- version control
- 👭 promotes collaboration
- 🏭 industry standard
- 🌎 language inclusive
- 🛠 interfaces with other tools (testing and deployment platforms)
- 💸 free (and open source)

## Common Terms:
- **git / Github:** Github: github.com (ie a hosting service). Git is a tool/system for version control management.
- **repository (repo):** directory or group of files
- **local / remote:** the copy of code on your machine vs the copy that is hosted
- **pull request (pr):** a request to merge changes into a different branch
- **diff:** the changes made from one version compared to another
- **master:** default branch
- **branch:** a copy of the repository which you can diff against the master branch
- **fork / clone** Cloning is still connected to the original remote. Forking makes a copy so a full copy of the repo with a new master branch is saved under your username.

## Basic Commands
- `git clone <repo>`
- `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
- `git branch`
- `git status`
- `git diff`
- `git add`
- `git commit -m 'useful message about the commit'`
- `git push origin <branch name>`
